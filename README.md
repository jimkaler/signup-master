## Deployment
When you have decided how to host the application open ".\src\constants\urls.js" file and specify required values for 'API_HOST' and 'CLIENT_HOST' constants.
'API_HOST' should point to WEB API server URL.
'CLIENT_HOST' should point to a server URL where the client application is supplied from.
